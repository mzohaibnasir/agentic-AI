    "It seems like you're trying to define a `State` class with a `messages` key that holds a list of messages, and you're annotating the list to be updated by an `add_messages` function. There is a small issue with the code. You need to close the `Annotated` function properly, and the `add_messages` function should be referenced as a callable or a function that modifies the list. Here's how you can modify the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypedDict, List\n",
    "from typing_extensions import Annotated\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_messages(messages: List[str], new_message: str) -> List[str]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Example function to add a message to the list.\"\"\"\n",
    "    messages.append(new_message)\n",
    "    return messages\n",
    "\n",
    "class State(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: Annotated[List[str], add_messages]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. `State` is a `TypedDict` that defines a dictionary structure.\n",
    "2. The `messages` key is annotated with `Annotated[List[str], add_messages]`, indicating that the value is a list of strings (`List[str]`), and the `add_messages` function will modify it.\n",
    "3. The `add_messages` function is defined to append a new message to the list and return the updated list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `add_messages` is meant to be used to update the state, you'll need to ensure that this function is applied when modifying the `messages` field, as it's not directly related to the data type annotation itself. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or adjustments!"
